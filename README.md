# ClassicBot
Repo for ClassicBot ESP project

# Kinda works
- Wifi Access
- Initialising the display
- Simple rendering
- Getting the Time via NTP and drawing it.

# TODO
- Finish getting the DisplayLayer stuff working, so the screen can be divided up in to regions.
- Port the eye blink from Arduino-y-mess into C++ loveliness.
- Look around within the bound of the eye region
- Get a weather forecast, and display cute pixel art.

# NICE TO HAVE
- Add an MPU6050 and have the eyes react to orientation; movement.
- Get the time to work nicer, using a RTC or something.
- Add a MicroSD slot, read config and data from it rather than hardcoding it.
- Get a DHT44 to do temperature, humidity.
